    <description><![CDATA[ElasticSearch SIEM Detections and Alerts and Actions are quite useful features, except for the fact that actual alerting is behind a license paywall. So while both of these features can run rules, check for conditions, and record the results in an index, neither of them actually provide alerting support.

A bit more searching led me here.
So provided_name is a method of templating index names it seems, using date math as explained in the documentation.
Just make sure to HTML encode the index name, as per the example from the documentation:]]></description>
