    <title>Azure Translation Services with Elasticsearch and Logstash</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Recently had a need to parse some XML into Elasticsearch, specifically some CERT RSS feeds. Logstash has an RSS input, but it&rsquo;s a bit basic, and doesn&rsquo;t provide any language indications if the RSS feed includes them. One of the feeds I&rsquo;m using can be various languages per item, and many others are non-english entirely.
Since this would be parsing the same RSS feeds repeatedly, I need a predictable Document ID, so I can re-insert / upsert the item, and not create a new document every time the RSS feed is parsed.]]></description>

    <title>Alerting using SIEM Detections and ElastAlert2</title>

    <description><![CDATA[ElasticSearch SIEM Detections and Alerts and Actions are quite useful features, except for the fact that actual alerting is behind a license paywall. So while both of these features can run rules, check for conditions, and record the results in an index, neither of them actually provide alerting support.
Alerting requires a Gold License, which if alerting is the only thing you want, is an excessive cost.
If you can&rsquo;t move off ElasticSearch to OpenSearch, which has Alerting available for free, you can use tools such as ElastAlert21 to handle the Alerting requirements.]]></description>

    <title>Using Elasticsearch Upserts to Combine Multiple Event Lines Into One</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Note This approach is probably not appropriate for high volume / high throughput events. It required in my case quite a lot of Logstash parsing, and Elasticsearch doc_as_upsert use, both of which will have a significant performance penalty. For low throughput use it works fine.
 Sometimes log sources split logically grouped events into separate lines, and sometimes those logically grouped event lines are mixed into the same log file with actual singular line events.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[At my work we use the Elastic Stack for quite a few things, but one of the more recent-ish &ldquo;official&rdquo; roles is as our SIEM. Elastic introduced SIEM specific funcationality to Kibana a few releases ago, around 7.4 if I rembember correctly.
One of the features that the Elastic Stack doesn&rsquo;t really support well (yet) is an enrichment system. They did introduce an elasticsearch side enrichment system in 7.5, but in my opinionn theres a few problems with it:]]></description>

    <title>Kibaba Authentication using OAuth2 Proxy in Kubernetes</title>

    <description><![CDATA[NOTE: There appears to be a bug with Kibanas impersonation features, and SIEM detection rules (and possibly elswhere): https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/74828
 Recently I had reason to want to integrate Kibana with Azure Active Directory for authentication. This might be easily possible if you have a commercial license with Elastic, but this wasn&rsquo;t the case this time.
After a little bit of research I found this article, from February 2017:
